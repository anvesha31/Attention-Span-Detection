# Attention-Span-Detection
The project aim to understand and analyze human attention and focus in various contexts, such as educational settings and human-computer interaction.The projects leverages computer vision techniques to track and analyze eye movements, pupil dilation, and facial expressions to infer the level of attention or focus of an individual.

Attention span detection involves assessing an individual's ability to maintain focus and attention on a task or stimulus over a period of time. This can be crucial in educational environments, where educators need to gauge students' engagement and adjust their teaching methods accordingly. 

Eye gaze estimation focuses on accurately determining the direction of a person's gaze by analyzing eye movements and pupil positions. This information is valuable in human-computer interaction systems, where understanding a user's gaze can improve user experience and enable novel interaction techniques
